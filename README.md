# InTeC Framework

The InTeC Framework, derived from Inference at Things, in a Things-Edge-Cloud Architecture, is a versatile software solution meticulously designed to facilitate and optimize the execution of machine learning pipelines within the layered architecture of Things, Edge, and Cloud. It primarily focuses on task distribution, including validation, preprocessing, model training, model analysis, and model deployment, with the overarching goal of enhancing system responsiveness and minimizing latency, network traffic, throughput, and energy consumption. This framework is assessed and compared to existing solutions in the context of addressing the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) challenge within a smart home environment, utilizing the MHEALTH dataset as a fundamental data source.

## Description

The InTeC Framework addresses the challenge of increasing latency and network traffic in responding to IoT data inferences. It introduces a comprehensive framework designed to distribute all components of the machine learning pipeline across the edge-cloud-things layers. This includes tasks such as validation, preprocessing, model training, model analysis, and model deployment, with a particular focus on distributing model deployment to the "things" layer. By doing so, the framework aims to enhance the system's response time.

To combat the growing data analysis processing load at the edge layer, the framework offers a solution by distributing model deployment to the "things" layer, assuming a minimum processing power for these IoT devices. The core hypothesis of this research is that by implementing a distributed machine learning pipeline technique within the edge-cloud-things architecture—where learning models are deployed on each IoT device to analyze data generated by sensors—it can significantly reduce system latency, network traffic, throughput, and edge energy consumption.

The InTeC implementations are evaluated and compared against related works in the context of solving the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) problem within a smart home environment. This is accomplished using the MHEALTH dataset as the primary data source. The framework's performance in HAR tasks is assessed and compared to existing solutions.
